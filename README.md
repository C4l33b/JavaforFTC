# LearnJavaForFTC
This is for learning Java for FTC

[Draft of the book](LearnJavaForFTC.pdf)

1. This is "a work in progress" - meaning it has had no checks for grammar, technical correctness, or anything else.
2. The only thing I think is missing are the sample solutions after chapter 12
3. The main things I am looking for at this point are things that are unclear (or incorrect)
4. I would *love* it if you would put [your comments here](https://github.com/alan412/LearnJavaForFTC/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=book-comments.md&title=)
